18:13:13	 From Krishnamurti Subramanian to Doug Chang (Privately) : ok, thanks. I sent you an email with the error
18:16:08	 From Doug Chang to Krishnamurti Subramanian (Privately) : You can delete the anaconda3 directory and reinstall anaconda3 then recreate your condo env and install numpy
18:16:12	 From Niha to Doug Chang (Privately) : Sorry I misjudged my work. I just wasn't able to find time to dedicate to this for the past couple of days. I'll spend some time on it this weekend but right now I am figuring out how to load the MNIST data
18:16:36	 From Niha to Doug Chang (Privately) : I think it would be worth your time if I try to make some more progress first
18:18:47	 From Doug Chang to Niha (Privately) : Ok… !!! There are 2 parts to mnist loading. 1 part, the old way about 2y old is to download mnist in gz files, decompress and read each one into memory, splitting each into training and test sets. The other way is to use the torch utilities which does all this for you. Either way good but the long way is good wo using the torch utils bc you will have to have those skills for dealing w/your own images. Good idea!!! Ok we can chat next week.

18:33:43	 From Niha to Doug Chang (Privately) : Ok sounds good. Yes I saw that pytorch can load the data but I think it's better to know how to load and format this kind of data. Thanks!
18:35:10	 From Doug Chang to Niha (Privately) : yes 100% agree w/you. The work habits are what will make you successful. If you take shortcuts then the managers will never trust you. They have seen it all before and they won’t hire people that don’t work the right way
