18:11:10	 From Michal Fabinger : tokyodatascience.com
18:12:21	 From Doug Chang : yes
18:12:26	 From Doug Chang : Can give lectures
18:12:37	 From Doug Chang : maybe a 10 minute one like what Richard did
18:28:21	 From Michal Fabinger : We are having a 5 minute break until 10:33 Japan time
18:32:55	 From Doug Chang : https://github.com/pouannes/TokyoDS/blob/master/course.pdf
18:34:15	 From Doug Chang : Great idea
18:34:18	 From Doug Chang : very exciting
18:34:31	 From Atiq : Awesome!
18:35:10	 From abhishek : Yes !
18:35:32	 From Shubham : sounds great!!
18:35:33	 From Richard : nothing quite like some competition to make work pass like a breeze
18:41:56	 From Atiq : sorry, I am late today, I think I missed most important things :(
18:42:31	 From Atiq : ok
18:44:42	 From Michal Fabinger : Please email me at fabinger@gmail.com to get access to our Slack and Piazza websites.
18:53:40	 From Atiq : Thanks
19:02:08	 From Michal Fabinger : If you are joining us to the first time, I would be happy to explain everything about our school in a separate video chat.
19:02:10	 From Michal Fabinger : We are having a 10-minute break until 11:10 Japan time.
19:14:08	 From Ernesto Castillo : I would like to do it
19:14:15	 From Prafful : Me too
19:19:11	 From Ernesto Castillo : What does m stand for?
19:25:09	 From Niha : what is the purpose of the bias?
19:33:21	 From Michal Fabinger : We are having a break until 11:38.
19:35:43	 From Michal Fabinger : Here is the notation sheet by Andrew Ng: https://cs230.stanford.edu/files/Notation.pdf
19:36:52	 From Doug Chang : The bias controls where the intercept is for the regression line
19:36:59	 From Doug Chang : 0 means it goes through the origin
19:37:09	 From Doug Chang : Linear model assumption
19:37:16	 From Doug Chang : slope + y intercept
19:37:29	 From Doug Chang : So they extend that to linear classification
19:37:46	 From Doug Chang : slope and y intercept

19:49:08	 From Michal Fabinger : https://cs230.stanford.edu/files/Notation.pdf
19:51:58	 From Atiq : I am still learning basics
19:52:07	 From Doug Chang : Have project
19:52:12	 From Richard : Mild delays in dataset manipulation
19:52:26	 From Doug Chang : BERT on Kaggle toxic classification dataset
19:52:31	 From Atiq : I am interested in speech recognition systems
19:53:27	 From Doug Chang : yes
19:53:43	 From Doug Chang : ok
19:54:03	 From Doug Chang : yes
19:55:10	 From Atiq : right
19:55:53	 From Atiq : o
19:55:55	 From Atiq : ok
