Dataset Descriptions
Each row is a query-document pair. The first column is relevance label of this pair, the second column is query id, the following columns are features, and
the end of the row is comment about the pair, including id of the document. The larger the relevance label, the more relevant the query-document pair. A

query-document pair is represented by a 46-dimensional feature vector.
